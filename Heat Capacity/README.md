The amount of energy required to increase the temperature of one gram of a material
by one degree Celsius is the material’s specific heat capacity, C. The total amount
of energy required to raise m grams of a material by ΔT degrees Celsius can be
computed using the formula:

q = mCΔT.

The program reads the mass of some water and the temperature change
from the user. The program displays the total amount of energy that must be
added or removed to achieve the desired temperature change.
I Extended my program so that it also computes the cost of heating the water. Electricity is 
normally billed using units of kilowatt hours rather than Joules. In this
exercise, I write the real electricity costs in Azerbaijan which is 7 coins per kilowatt-hour. 
You can use program to compute the cost of boiling water for a cup of coffee.
