I have just opened a new savings account that earns 4 percent interest
per year. The interest that I earn is paid at the end of the year, and is added
to the balance of the savings account. 
The program begins by reading the amount of money 
deposited into the account from the user. Then program
computes and displays the amount in the savings account after 1, 2, and 3 years. Displays
each amount so that it is rounded to 2 decimal places.
