Consider the software that runs on a self-checkout machine. One task that it must be
able to perform is to determine how much change to provide when the shopper pays
 for a purchase with cash.
The program begins by reading a number of coins from the user as an
integer. Then program computes and displays the denominations of the
coins that should be used to give that amount of change to the shopper. The change
should be given using as few coins as possible. Assume that the machine is loaded
with pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, loonies and toonies.
